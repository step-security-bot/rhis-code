# Onboarding

This project onboarding document is designed to provide new team members
with a comprehensive introduction to the project, ensuring a smooth and
efficient integration into the team. It outlines the project’s
objectives, scope, and deliverables, offering a clear understanding of
our goals and expectations. The document includes detailed information
on the project timeline, key milestones, and critical deadlines.
Additionally, it introduces the project team, clarifying roles and
responsibilities to facilitate effective collaboration. Essential
resources, tools, and communication channels are highlighted to equip
new members with the necessary support for their tasks. By following
this onboarding guide, new team members will be well-prepared to
contribute to the project’s success from the outset.

## Project Management

A key component of our project management and follow-up process is the
use of an [RH internal JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SHWRM)
system. This section of the document explains how JIRA is utilized to
track project progress, manage tasks, and ensure timely completion of
deliverables. Instructions on accessing and navigating the JIRA system,
along with best practices for updating tasks and communicating within
the platform, are provided to help new members quickly become proficient
in its use. By following this onboarding guide and effectively
leveraging JIRA, new team members will be well-prepared to contribute to
the project’s success from the outset.

It is recommended to request a user story to be onboarded from other
team members through JIRA. Please ensure that all the necessary tools
are accessible from your side when JIRA user story completed.

## Collaboration

Slack is our main collaboration tool for real-time communication and
team interaction. This section details how Slack is used for daily
communications, sharing updates, and quick problem-solving. Guidelines
on joining relevant channels, best practices for messaging, and tips for
effective use of Slack are included to help new members integrate
seamlessly into the team’s communication flow. By following this
onboarding guide and effectively leveraging JIRA and Slack, new team
members will be well-prepared to contribute to the project’s success
from the outset.

Following channels are used in Slack:

1.  [cop-rhis-steeringcommittee](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07TDC6QUCU) : RHIS Technical Steering Committee Channel
2.  [cop-rhis-general](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07TAP5PJ8K) : Main RHIS Channel
3.  [cop-rhis-notifications](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06VCEWRQE4) : Notifications Channel only

## Cloud Resources

In this project, we leverage Azure cloud resources as the foundational
infrastructure to ensure scalability, reliability, and security. Azure’s
robust suite of services enables seamless deployment, management, and
scaling of applications. By utilizing Azure’s
infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS)
offerings, we can efficiently handle computational workloads, data
storage, and networking requirements. This integration facilitates
optimized performance and cost-effective resource management, laying a
strong foundation for the project’s success.

The project is the organizational name, and required to the
switched to the directory when an access is required.

We utilize the project organization to access Red Hat (RH)
resources through the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. This integration
allows us to manage and deploy Red Hat services efficiently within our
project infrastructure. By leveraging the Hybrid Cloud Console, we
streamline resource management, ensuring seamless coordination and
optimized performance across our cloud and on-premise environments. This
approach enhances our ability to deliver robust and scalable solutions.

Access to the resources:

1.  Azure Cloud Access: Red Hat account used to access with two-factor authentication
2.  Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console: A new Red Hat account used related with the new organization.

## GitHub Repositories

We use the [Red Hat CoP](https://github.com/redhat-cop)
organization on public GitHub.

1.  [Code repository](https://github.com/redhat-cop/rhis-code)
2.  [Inventory and variables repository](https://github.com/redhat-cop/rhis-inventory)

Team information, including details about individual members, is available in the [RHIS Code Team](https://github.com/orgs/redhat-cop/teams/rhis-code-admins) section on GitHub.

## Visual Workspace

Miro used as a visual workspace to facilitate brainstorming, planning,
and collaborative design. [The project
workspace](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKUIlyW8=/) is used at the
beginning to plan and prepare the project based on the Open Practice
Libraries.

Team information and availability is also tracked in this workspace.

## Credential Management

For secure credential management, we use a [Bitwarden
Vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com/) account associated with Red Hat,
Inc. This account stores all necessary credentials required for the
project, ensuring that sensitive information is protected and easily
accessible to authorized team members. By utilizing Bitwarden, we
maintain a high level of security and organization for our credentials,
supporting the overall integrity and efficiency of our project
operations.

## Agile Ceremonies

An Agile ceremony is an event in the Agile process where the team
gathers to discuss their next steps. Essentially, it’s a regular meeting
within the Agile framework. The main goal of an Agile ceremony is to
enhance communication among team members, ensuring alignment and shared
understanding. These ceremonies are typically led by product owners.

There are four key Agile ceremonies:

1.  [the daily stand-up meeting](https://meet.google.com/aqa-fhvw-syx) : **Every weekdays** at 11:45 (GMT +1)
2.  [the sprint planning meeting](https://meet.google.com/gri-awvj-jay) : Every 2 weeks on **Friday** at 11:30 (GMT +1)
3.  [the sprint review meeting](https://meet.google.com/owq-gfhg-whr) : Every 2 weeks on **Thursday** at 16:00 (GMT +1)
4.  [the sprint retrospective meeting](https://meet.google.com/qap-rsqv-xgg) : Every 2 weeks on **Friday** at 10 (GMT +1)
